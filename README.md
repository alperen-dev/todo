# todo
 simple todo app written in javascript (vanilla & a tad bit of jquery), did this yesterday in about 6h cuz i was bored & also needed a personal todo list lol
 
tbh its useful but i could implement date/datetime + a mongodb and buy a domain to publish it... maybe i'll do it but there is no need for it now as I'm already working on another nosql project...

however ty for visiting! for any questions email me at alp-eren.42@outlook or alperen.yilmaz@stud.edubs.ch
